**Tradeoffs**:
- ‚úÖ Better performance with fewer re-renders
- ‚úÖ Type-safe validation with Zod
- ‚úÖ Better error handling and validation patterns
- ‚úÖ Smaller bundle size
- ‚ùå Learning curve for developers unfamiliar with uncontrolled components
- ‚ùå More complex setup compared to simple controlled components

### 8. TypeScript with Strict Configuration
**Decision**: Use TypeScript with strict mode enabled
**Rationale**:
- Prevents runtime errors through compile-time checking
- Better IDE support and refactoring capabilities
- Enforces better coding practices
- Self-documenting code with explicit types

**Tradeoffs**:
- ‚úÖ Better type safety and error prevention
- ‚úÖ Improved developer experience and IDE support
- ‚úÖ Better code maintainability and refactoring
- ‚úÖ Self-documenting code
- ‚ùå Initial development overhead
- ‚ùå Learning curve for developers new to TypeScript

### 9. Row Level Security for Data Isolation
**Decision**: Implement RLS policies for user data isolation
**Rationale**:
- Security enforced at the database level
- No risk of application-level security bypass
- Database-level filtering is more efficient
- Reduces complexity in application code

**Tradeoffs**:
- ‚úÖ Database-level security enforcement
- ‚úÖ Automatic security without application logic
- ‚úÖ Better performance with database-level filtering
- ‚úÖ Simpler application code
- ‚ùå Complex policy management and debugging
